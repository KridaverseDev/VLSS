    Question: "What are Lingayath's believes ? ",
    Answer:
      "Lingayats believe in a form of monotheism centered on Lord Shiva, whom they worship through the Ishtalinga, a personal lingam symbolizing direct and individual connection with the divine. They reject the traditional Hindu caste system and rituals, emphasizing instead a life of personal piety, ethical conduct, and social equality. Key to their faith are the concepts of Kayaka (work as worship) and Dasoha (selfless service), reflecting their belief in the sanctity of labor and the importance of community welfare. Lingayats also value the teachings encapsulated in the Vachanas, poetic writings that emphasize direct spiritual experience and social reform.",
